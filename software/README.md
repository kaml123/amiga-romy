# 1MB/2MB/4MB ROM Builder for ROMY

This tool will build larger Kickstart ROMs for (almost) all Amigas.

* Support for Kickstart 3.1.4 (46.143) 3.1.4.1 (46.160) and 3.2 (47.96). You will need the original Amiga OS ZIP files / ISO file.
* On 3.1.4 it exchanges all resident modules from the 3.1.4.1 Updates disk
* On 3.1.4 it replaces intuition.library with intuition v45
* It will add icon.library and workbench.library from the Install disk
* It will create a rom-able HRTmon and add it to the image
* On Amiga 1200, it will add ehide.device to boot off TF1260 IDE
* Tested on A500 / A1200 / A3000D / A4000D (success / failure reports welcome)
* 3.2: Add CDFileSystem to the image
* Simple "module" system to add your own extensions easily

# How to build

* You will need romtools from the amitools package installed: https://github.com/cnvogelg/amitools
  ```pip install -U git+https://github.com/cnvogelg/amitools.git```
* You will also need to install srecord : sudo apt-get install srecord 7z
* On MacOS: brew install srecord coreutils 7-zip bash
* 3.1.4: Put your Amiga OS files (e.g. AmigaOS-3.1.4-A4000.zip and AmigaOS-3.1.4.1-Update.zip) into your
$HOME/Downloads folder
* 3.2: Place an ISO of your 3.2 CD in $HOME/Downloads/AmigaOS3.2CD.iso

Then type:
```
 $ make
 ROMY 1MB/2MB/4MB Kickstart patcher

 Usage:

  $ make kickstart TARGETS="A500 A4000" VERSION=47.96 SIZES="1mb 4mb"

  TARGETS
   - A500
   - A1200
   - A3000
   - A4000
   - A4000T

  SIZES
   - 1mb (*)
   - 2mb (**)
   - 4mb (**)

   (*) 0xe00000 base    (**) 0x1000000 base

  VERSION
   - 46.143
   - 46.160
   - 47.96

  For CDTV, A500, A600, A1000, A2000 use the A500 image
  For CD32, please talk to me

  Defaults
   TARGETS="A500 A1200 A3000 A4000 A4000T"
   VERSION="47.96"
   SIZES="1mb 2mb 4mb"
```

 Now, if you want to build a 1MB Kickstart 3.2 image for the Amiga 4000, you write:
```
 $ make kickstart TARGETS="A4000" SIZES="1mb" VERSION="47.96"
 ROMY 1MB/2MB/4MB Kickstart patcher

 Fasten your seatbelts and hold your breath (no, better don't!)

 Processing Kickstart 47.96 for A4000 (1mb)
 Success! Now write build/47.96/kick.a4000.47.96.1mb.LO.bin and build/47.96/kick.a4000.47.96.1mb.HI.bin to two 27C400(1M)/27C160(4M) chips (A4000).

 $
```

# How to flash

You can flash the two resulting files to two 27C400 (or comparable) EPROMs.
Note that in order for the resulting Kickstart to work, you will have to have
ROMY installed in your Amiga 4000D.


# How to use

You should have an ikod.se INT7 adapter installed in order to use HRTmon (or
some other means of triggering INT7)

# Special Notes

## A1200

You won't need a ROMY to address 1MB Kickstarts

## Amiga 3000D

You will need a ROMY to address 1MB or 4MB Kickstarts. The Amiga 3000 comes in various revisions. If you have your ROMs in U182/U183 or are using a ROM tower, you need to use one of Chris Hooper's ROM Bank Switchers and connect the address lines to ROMY. If you want to use 4MB Kickstarts you will need to connect 2 more address lines between the Kickstart and the ROMY unconditionally (Watch the hardware section)

## A4000D

You will need a ROMY to address 1MB or 4MB Kickstarts. If you want to use 4MB
Kickstarts you will need to connect 2 more address lines between the Kickstart
and the ROMY unconditionally (Watch the hardware section)

## A4000T

You need to update P652 to make your ROMY work. I don't have an A4000T so I can
not test anything here. Please help!
